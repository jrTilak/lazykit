- `function`: (required) The function that will be executed after the specified count of calls has been reached.
- `count`: (required) A number indicating the count of calls required before executing the function.

## Usage

The `callAfter` utility creates a wrapper function that delays execution of the provided function `fn` until it has been called a specified number of times. Each call increments an internal counter until it reaches the `count` threshold. Once the threshold is met, `fn` is executed with the given arguments, returning its result. Before the threshold, the function returns `undefined`.

### Example

```javascript
"use js-executor"
import callAfter from "@/utils/callAfter";

// Create a function that logs a message
const logMessage = (msg) => console.log(msg);

// Set up a delayed function that only executes after 3 calls
const delayedLog = callAfter(logMessage, 3);

delayedLog("Hello"); // No output
delayedLog("Hello"); // No output
delayedLog("Hello"); // No output
delayedLog("Hello again!"); // Logs "Hello again!" immediately on 4th call
delayedLog("Hello again! 2");
```

This utility is useful when you want to delay function execution until a specific event or condition occurs multiple times, making it ideal for situations where you only want an action to occur after several triggers or validations.
