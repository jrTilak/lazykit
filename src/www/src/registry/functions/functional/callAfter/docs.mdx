desc: Returns a new function that can be called only after calling a specific number of times.

<CodePreview methodName="callAfter"/>

## Installtion

```bash
npx @jrtilak/lazykit add callAfter
```

## Parameters

- `fn` (`(...args: S) => T`)  
  The function to be called after the specified count. This function will receive the same arguments that are passed to the returned function.

- `count` (`number`)  
  The number of times the returned function must be called before `fn` is executed.

## Returns

- `((...args: S) => T | undefined)`  
  Returns a new function that, when called, will only execute `fn` after it has been called the specified number of times. Until that point, it will return `undefined`.

## Type Parameters

- `T`  
  The return type of the function `fn`.

- `S`  
  The type of the arguments accepted by the function `fn`. This allows the returned function to accept the same parameters as `fn`, ensuring type safety.

## Usage

The `callAfter` utility creates a wrapper function that delays execution of the provided function `fn` until it has been called a specified number of times. Each call increments an internal counter until it reaches the `count` threshold. Once the threshold is met, `fn` is executed with the given arguments, returning its result. Before the threshold, the function returns `undefined`.

### Example

```javascript
"use js-executor"
import callAfter from "@/utils/callAfter";

// Create a function that logs a message
const logMessage = (msg) => console.log(msg);

// Set up a delayed function that only executes after 3 calls
const delayedLog = callAfter(logMessage, 3);

delayedLog("Hello"); // No output
delayedLog("Hello"); // No output
delayedLog("Hello"); // No output
delayedLog("Hello again!"); // Logs "Hello again!" immediately on 4th call
delayedLog("Hello again! 2");
```

This utility is useful when you want to delay function execution until a specific event or condition occurs multiple times, making it ideal for situations where you only want an action to occur after several triggers or validations.
