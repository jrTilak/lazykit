- `function`: (required) The function to be executed before reaching the specified call count.
- `count`: (required) A number representing the maximum number of times the function can be executed before it stops returning a result.

## Usage

The `callBefore` utility creates a function wrapper that allows the provided function `fn` to execute only for the first `count` calls. After reaching the `count` threshold, further calls will return `undefined`, making it useful for limiting how often a function can run.

### Example

```javascript
"use js-executor"
import callBefore from "@/utils/callBefore";

// Define a function that logs a message
const logMessage = (msg) => console.log(msg);

// Create a limited function that only logs for the first 2 calls
const limitedLog = callBefore(logMessage, 2);

limitedLog("Hello"); // Logs "Hello"
limitedLog("Hello again!"); // Logs "Hello again!"
limitedLog("This will not be logged"); // No output
limitedLog("Still no output"); // No output
```

In this example, `limitedLog` only executes `logMessage` for the first two calls. Subsequent calls after reaching the threshold simply return `undefined` without executing the function, which can be useful for rate-limiting or pre-conditionally restricting function calls.
