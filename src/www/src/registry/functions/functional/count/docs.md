desc: returns the result of a function and the number of times that function is invoked.

The `count` function invokes another function passed as an `arg` and returns both the `result` of the invoked function and the `count of how many times the function has been called`.

This is useful in when you need to keep a tab on how many times a function is being called which can be helpful in monitoring,debugging,testing,anayltics,resource management.
