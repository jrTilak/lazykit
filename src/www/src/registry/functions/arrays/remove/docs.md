desc: Removes elements from an array at a specified index.
---

The remove function is a generic function in TypeScript that is designed to remove elements from an array at a specified index. The function takes two parameters: an array arr of type T[], an index or array of indices of type number.

It returns a new array with the elements removed at the specified index without modifying the original array. If the index is negative, the index is treated as an index from the end of the array.
