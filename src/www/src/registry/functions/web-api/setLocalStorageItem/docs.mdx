<CodePreview methodName="setLocalStorageItem"/>

## Installtion

```bash
npx @jrtilak/lazykit add setLocalStorageItem
```

## Props
<PropsTable methodName="setLocalStorageItem"/>

---

- `key`: (required) A string representing the key name for the item in `localStorage`.
- `value`: (required) The data to be stored in `localStorage`; can be any type.
- `config`: (optional) Can be an object or function. When `defaultParser` is set to `true`, values are JSON stringified if they are objects or arrays. Alternatively, a custom parsing function can be provided to format the value.

---
The function `setLocalStorageItem` returns a `boolean` value:

- `true`: Indicates that the item was successfully stored in `localStorage`.
- `false`: Indicates that storing the item in `localStorage` failed. This might occur if `localStorage` is not available (for example, in a server environment or if the browser does not support it), or if there's an error during parsing or storage.

The return value allows you to handle cases where storage might fail gracefully.

## Example Usage

### Saving an object to localStorage
```javascript
"use js-executor";
import setLocalStorageItem from "@/helpers/setLocalStorageItem";

const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  role: "admin",
};

// Stores the object using the default JSON parser
setLocalStorageItem("user", user);
```

### Using a custom parsing function
```javascript
"use js-executor";
import setLocalStorageItem from "@/helpers/setLocalStorageItem";

const score = 85;

// Custom parser to add a prefix
setLocalStorageItem("userScore", score, (value) => `Score-${value}`);
```

In this example:
- The first usage stores a user object as a JSON string in `localStorage`.
- The second usage stores a number, prefixed as `"Score-85"`.
