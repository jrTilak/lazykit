# lazykit.config.json

The `lazykit.config.json` or `package.lazykit` file is a configuration file generated by the LazyKit CLI during the initialization process. This file serves as a central hub for customizing and managing your LazyKit settings within your project. It allows you to define preferences that dictate how LazyKit integrates with your codebase.

## Structure of lazykit.config.json

The configuration file is structured in JSON format, making it easy to read and edit. Below are the key components typically included in this file:
- **v**: A string that indicates the version of the LazyKit CLI used to generate this configuration file.


- **language**: Indicates the chosen programming language for your project, either `"typescript"` or `"javascript"`.

- **separate**: A boolean value that determines whether the configuration settings are stored in this separate file (`true`) or in the `package.json` file under the `lazykit` property (`false`).

- **paths**: An object that specifies where to store utility functions and React hooks:
  - **helperFunctionsPath**: A string that defines the directory where utility functions will be stored. This path is relative to the root of your project.
  - **reactHooksPath**: A string that indicates the directory where React hooks will be saved, also relative to the root of your project.

- **filenameConvention**: An object that defines the casing convention for filenames:
  - **helperFunctions**: The naming convention for utility functions, allowing for `camelCase` or `kebab-case`.
  - **reactHooks**: The naming convention for React hooks, also allowing for `camelCase` or `kebab-case`.

## Example of lazykit.config.json

Here's an example of what the `lazykit.config.json` file might look like:

```json
{
  "v": "2.0.0",
  "language": "typescript",
  "separate": true,
  "paths": {
    "helperFunctionsPath": "@/helpers",
    "reactHooksPath": "@/hooks"
  },
  "filenameConvention": {
    "helperFunctions": "camelCase",
    "reactHooks": "kebab-case"
  }
}
```
