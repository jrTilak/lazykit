# Introduction

## What is lazykit?

Welcome to LazyKit - the ultimate toolkit for simplifying JavaScript and TypeScript development. In an ever-evolving landscape of web technologies, developers often find themselves `reinventing the wheel` when it comes to writing utility functions for common tasks. LazyKit was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: to provide developers with a comprehensive collection of utility functions that can be easily added to the projects and customized to suit their needs.

## The idea behind it.

LazyKit is built on the principle of efficiency and ease of use. The idea stemmed from the recognition that developers spend a significant amount of time writing boilerplate code for routine tasks such as array manipulation, string manipulation, etc. By centralizing these common functionalities into a place, LazyKit empowers developers to focus their time and energy on solving unique challenges and building innovative solutions.
